## A new beginning

So I decided to unearth my old blog which was startet around 2014 on github pages with jekyll. This time i wanted to try hugo and import old content here. 
After looking though the 2 articles I wrote back in the day, I decided to leave them be. They were about playing around with Django-CMS and a contribution to cromelogger-python. If such things are really of interest to you, you can find these in older versions of this repository ().

## Using hugo

Hugo is a modern static site generator, much like jekyll. Go instead of Ruby, maybe a bit more flexible, but not directly supported by github. Some say, hugo is a bit trickier to learn, but blazing fast. I just wanted to try it out :smile:
