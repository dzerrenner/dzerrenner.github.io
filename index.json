This time I wanted to try hugo and import old content here. After looking though the 2 articles I wrote back in the day, I decided to leave them be. They were about playing around with Django-CMS and a contribution to cromelogger-python.\nUsing hugo # Hugo is a modern static site generator, much like Jekyll. Go instead of Ruby, maybe a bit more flexible, but not directly supported by GitHub. Some say, hugo is a bit trickier to learn, but blazing fast. I just wanted to try it out ðŸ˜„\nThe setup and start to a basic site with a custom template was easy, maybe 20 to 30 minutes. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I run into some roadblocks if I want to change some major stuff, but it\u0026rsquo;ll suffice for now. No big issues yet, I basically just followed the tutorial.\nDeploying # The documentation also has a nice section about deploying the site to GitHub pages, which I have done. To use it on your own CI/CD solution, it all boils down to running the script to generate the site and copy/upload the output directory to the desired destination.\nCustom domain and Cloudflare # GitHub pages supports serving personal and project pages using an own domain. I use Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s DNS to point the domain to GitHub pages. I also could do this on the registrars site, but with an own DNS I feel more flexible, I plan to update some things and possibly need some subdomains pointing all over the place. Just as I wrap up this article, I found out that there is also a possibility to host such a site directly on Cloudflare.\nConclusion # All this said (which is nothing interesting at all\u0026hellip;), this is basically an article to test the installation and the DevOps pipeline ðŸ˜Š. Ignore this and enjoy other posts and this image of some llamas I took some years ago in a zoo.\nSome llamas, picture taken 2015 in Cologne zoo.
